# Simplistic-Design
This was a fun side project with the premise of being a very simple and but enticing website

## Usefulness
This project is helpful because it can help individuals rethink basic deign elements of a website.

### Why
I wanted to create a website that I personally would like to see but have yet to encounter.

So I took it upon myself to make one that veered off the path of a "traditional" website and make one a bit more **interseting**
